                <p> In our work on A3 we used a variety of tools to share our work and progress with eachother. For communications we almost predominately relied on Ms Teams for both meetings and team messaging. We also used MsTeams as our shared work drive to which team members would add all their individual sections to a dedicated folder in the ‘files tab’. Following this members would send a supplementary message in the chat to inform the group that a section has been added. 
<br>
In the MS Teams ‘files’ tab is also where we kept the ‘Final Report’ Document which was a collaborative Microsoft Word Document. We also had numerous backup files of this ‘Final Report’ on MS Teams in the case that the main file became corrupted. 
<br>
Individually most members used Google Docs to write up contextual sections so that the file would be stored in the cloud for security and accessed across numerous devices for convenience.

In making our website, Ivan created a GitHub repository alongside code for a website template. Using HTML & CSS our code (which contained our report content) was uploaded individually to a shared GitHub repository where members would push commits whilst also saving a backup of their individual code on their computer after having been written up on Atom. Our audit trail on GitHub shows we pushed numerous sets of code to secure our work/progress and worked well to create a well-presented and functioning website for our report. </p>
